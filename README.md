# tic-tac-toe

Classic game of tic tac toe, built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. The game simply selects a random available slot in the game's playing board and fills the spot with an X or an O. A counter is also built in to track the scores of both the player and the computer as the game progresses. A display window also instructs the player if it's their turn or the computer's turn. Finally, the computer's "strategic thinking" is implemented with a setTimeout method to simulate that the computer is taking different, varying lengths of time to make its move.
